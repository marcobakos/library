Generalizations

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve learned six commands commonly used to manage data stored in a relational database and how to set constraints on such data. What can we generalize so far?

SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.

    A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
    A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.

A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

    - CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
    - INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
    - SELECT queries data from a table.
    - ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
    - UPDATE edits a row in a table.
    - DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.
